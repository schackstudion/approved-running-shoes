# approved-running-shoes

A video-based tool that identifies forbidden shoes in running competitions
Building AI course project

## Summary

In 2020 World Athlecis introduced rules for what types of running shoes that are approved in different types of competitions. It's impossible to do this manually in big events with thousands of runners. The organizers need a machine learned and video based AI-tool. 

## Background

The rules have been modified frequently, and during the first year, organizers did not take them into account. An AI-based tool would need to:
1) Get access to photos from the race
2) Identify runners with their BIB-number (this already exists)
3) Connect the runners with their shoes
4) Identify the shoe model and check it from a list of approved shoes

## How is it used?

Organizers setting up cameras on races, and getting lists of runners whose shoes need to be checked.

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
